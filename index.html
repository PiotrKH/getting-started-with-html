tags can have multiple attributes 
<b>Anchor attribute </b>also called simply a-tag, are used for making links
<!-- example
<a href="www.org.at"> news </a> -->
<a href="www.orf.at">news</a>

Image tag <!--
<img src="image's_url" alt="image description, required, displayed when img doesn't load, for blind people">
-->
image tag doesn't have ending tag (so called <b>void-tag</b>, because it doesn't have a content, it doesn't need a closing tag

<b>Whitespace</b> <br>
<!-- use <br> tag -->
- start a new line with <b>br</b> (break line) tag (is a void tag) <br>
- <b>p</b> (paragraph) tag, has opening and closing tags <br>
<b>inline/block</b><br>
- br is an <em>inline</em> tag, ends the line, e.g. b, em, img <br>
- p is a <em>block</em> tag, makes an invisible box (a box which can have specific dimensions width, length) <br>

<p>Container elements</p>
Span (in line) / div (block) <br>
- both contain their content (both are non-void)
- one can attach styles to how the text can look like
<br>
trying out <span>what <em>span</em></span> looks like
<br>
on the other hand <div><em>div</em> makes a new line </div>
<br>
